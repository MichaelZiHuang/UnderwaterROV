# Capstone Project - Iceberg Explorer
<h1>Introduction</h1>
This project will focuses on expanding an already existing proposal by our client. Their central goal is to create new methods of measuring active glacial melt in the arctic. The final product this project is to provide an ROV capable of traveling 30m underwater in the Arctic ocean and be able to scan a timelapse of the changing topography of a melting glacier. With this, researchers will another method to accurately measure glacier melt without putting themselves in danger.

<h1>Current Status</h1>

To Do:
